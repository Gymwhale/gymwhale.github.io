  <h3>Summary of WODs</h3>

<p>The 5 most recent WODs covered everything from on ‘__’ functions, to for loops and replacing hard-coded variables. Each paragraph will go over into detail seperately. I had a fairly positive experience with this batch of WODs as it was very relevant to the course work and helps to provide us with clear examples of practice that curate to the labs. Reflecting upon my personal experience with all of the labs, I believe that there is much to be improved as I still constantly check the screencasts for solutions after a few tries. This can lead to a false sense of security in the future as I will not be able to screencast my way into the assignments or even later down the line in my career.</p>

<h3>BrowserHistory6</h3>

<p>BrowserHistory6 was for the most part, what I imagined that programmers worked on atleast with front end development. It was a great little project to get you accustomated with not only the tools of CSS, but also acclimate yourself with the tools and functions such as ‘onclick’, ‘onmouseover’, etc. Configuring the buttons were by far the reason for this WOD to have taken me multiple attempts for. One of the factors in the lengthy completion time for this WOD in particular had to do with the fact that I was extremely nitpicky about how precise the pictures had to be along with just a part of my need to be identical to the model product. In the future, I hope to do work similar to this and hopefully applying these skills to my own website as well.</p>

<h3>SmartPhoneProducts1 w/ Variable</h3>

<p>Obviously, this WOD was the easiest out of all other WODs in this batch because of the simplicity in the directions and just the concept in general. We’re essentially cleaning up the code with this WOD and trying to stray away from the hard-coding of objects. Seperating the product data from the rest of the code can also help us visualize what the code lines are doing in a more detailed manner. This of course had a connection with SmartPhoneProducts2, &amp; I even found it to have helped a lot more rather than the possibility of having to hard code the variables above the html code. All in all, this was a great break from the other complicated concepts while still exposing us to an important skillset to have as a programmer.</p>

<h3>Invoice 1</h3>

<p>I had a lot of fun with Invoice1. I had the fun idea of changing the product names into L&amp;L Drive Inn products. So, instead of the razers and gel used for the example I opted for the good old Chicken Katsu &amp; Arizona Iced Tea. I think this was also somewhat my downfall, as I had a difficult time following along with the directions and even looking over the screencast because I was getting confused at the different variable names. However, I think this was a very valuable WOD that taught us how difficult it can be to fix hard-coded lines but also how rewarding it can be to utilize variables that aren’t hard coded because it can open up possibilities such as this invoice receipt. The hardest part had to be using the tofixed function as it was somewhat hard to grasp, and I found that more decimals kept coming the more I added it which was extremely weird.</p>

<h3>Invoice 2</h3>

<p>A little bit less work than Invoice1, this WOD was a great debrief and experience for me to get familiarized with commenting more in my code. I had similar issues with the tofixed function except this time I believe that it had to do with me copying and pasting lines that didn’t have the formatting fix. I certainly will try to analyze my code more thoroughly and try to understand it better and better as I progress.</p>

<h3>SmartPhoneProducts2</h3>

<p>I resent this WOD for many reasons, but the main issue is my own wrong doing which I cannot fault on any external factors. I had essentially completed the WOD all the way up to the for-loop, but my webpage would not load properly the images. They were all condensed into one image that did not look like the original. I ended up solving the issue post standard time and I found that it was simply because I was missing a closed bracket that I deleted and forgot to retype after changing the img src line. Extremely frustrating, but I will be looking more carefully for stupid mistakes like that next time.</p>

<h3>Conclusion</h3>

<p>All in all, I think these set of WODs were helpful in staying in touch with the labs and the course content in general. Once again, it gives us real world examples and can show us flaws within our work to ultimately set us up to recreate these WODs all over again with the upcoming assignments. Mahalo for listening and taking the time to hear my reflection of my work.</p>
