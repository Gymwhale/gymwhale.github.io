*Adapting to the Sweeping Expansion of the Digital Age*

Going into college, I always had a passion for money and all things related to money. It may seem like the most cliche & basic aspiration for me, but I embraced the stereotype & ran with it.

Now, I'm halfway through my college career, & a few gears have changed in my brain. I definitely have a passion for all things money, but what lay underneath that bewildering passion was also a passion; & enjoyment for tech and the world of technology as a whole. 

With that in mind, I made the executive decision to pursue both. Why can't I do both? There's a certain type of charisma that comes with working in the tech industry. I'm not sure if it's the idolized work life balance of young professionals, or the handsome pay that is offered, perhaps the flexibility of working from home, or even just the feeling of working in a technologically advanced company.

Either way, the reason I decided to major in MIS was because I needed to meet the burning passion and love that I had for Tech.

Mahalo,
Jim
