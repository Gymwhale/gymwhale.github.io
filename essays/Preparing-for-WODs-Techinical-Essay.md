Summary of WODs
I actually procrasinated on doing these WODs until I was basically reminded multiple times by Zenan & P^2 to complete them, for my sake. I'm more than grateful for their little nudge however, as I grew to eventually love working on these past three WODs. Everything from acting like a youtuber/vlogger who had a large audience watching whilst I coded, to tinkering and troubleshooting all night and eventually getting (most of) it. I'll have to admit, every I actually had to complete multiple attempts for 2/3 WODs, & I even took 5 tries on the final BrowserHistory3, as it was just overall a complex and mixed bag of procedures that I just didn't experience in the previous two. Nonetheless, I completed them with the help of some screencasts, a ton of coffee & nap breaks, and especially with discipline and dedication to the craft.

BrowserHistory6
BrowserHistory1 was a very easy and helpful introductory WOD that went over things smoothly. My favorite aspect was how simplistic the procedure was yet it still provided a good chunk of work to be had and to be done. But, the steps were fairly straightforward and it was a lot of repetitive work that just got you to the end product of a very basic webpage about the history of Browsers. This was the first WOD I completed so I didn't understand very well how identitcal the end product must be to the required product, and so I missed a few points because of the links inside the paragraphs regarding each browser.

BrowserHistory2 was the first WOD that I had to complete with the help of a screencast. It was an interesting procedure that certainly increased in the level of difficulty while maintaining the workload of the previous directory in the best way that it could. Similarly with BrowserHistory1, I had a few inconsistencies with the final product not matching with the margins of the headers among a few other things.

Invoice 1
BrowserHistory3 essentially broke me, & fixed me right up all in the same night. This was one of the harder WODs so far, mostly because of how intricate it was from doing two very complex tasks, to the ease of committing mistakes off of very simple mistakes. Small points like padding and the margins of the headers were things that stumped me. I actually went back and ended up restarting all the way from BrowserHistory1 all the way up to BrowserHistory3 because I had believed that my code was just completely unfixable. I ended up fixing the mistakes I made in BrowserHistory 1 & 2 along with completing BrowserHistory3 with full marks.

Invoice 2
